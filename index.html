	 <h2>TIEN SHAN</h2>
	 <p class="info">Tien Shan is one of the largest mountain systems in Asia. Translated from Chinese Tien Shan means "Heavenly Mountains". The territory of Kazakhstan includes almost entirely the Northern Tien Shan, parts of the Central and Western Tien Shan.The central Tien Shan within Kazakhstan starts from the powerful Khan-Tengri (H-6995) mountain knot, at the junction of the borders of China, Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan. Further, it extends to the west with a whole series of ridges.</p>
	 <p class="info">The largest of them is Terskiy Alatau. The border with Kyrgyzstan runs along its eastern branch. The Northern Tien Shan ranges include: Ketmen, Kungey Alatau, Zailiyskiy Alatau, Chu-Ili mountains and Kyrgyz Alatau.
The Western Tien Shan includes the Talas ridge and the Ugam and Korzhintau ridges extending from it in a southeastern direction. Karatau is located completely within Kazakhstan - the most extreme, heavily destroyed region of the Tien Shan.</p>
	 <p class="info">Relief, geological structure and minerals. Tien Shan is located in the ancient geosynclinal belt. It is composed of metamorphosed shales, sandstones, gneisses, limestones and volcanic rocks of Precambrian and Lower Paleozoic deposits.
Later continental and lacustrine deposits are concentrated in the mountainous plains. They consist of clayey, sandy and moraine deposits. The main mountain systems: Trans-Ili Alatau - the northernmost high-mountain range of the Tien Shan, has a length of 350 km, a width of 30 - 40 km, an average height of 4000 m.</P>

	 <h2>AKTAU</h2>
	 <p class="info">Aktau is a large industrial city on the coast of the Caspian Sea in Kazakhstan, the administrative center of the Mangistau region, located in the south-west of the country. Aktau cannot be called an ordinary regional center of this largest state in Central Asia, it has a special status - the only seaport in Kazakhstan is located here. And in Aktau, for the first time in the world, engineers supplied drinking sea water desalinated with the help of atomic energy to the city water supply system. In recent years, the industrial component is increasingly being squeezed by the leisure and entertainment industry, and signs of a growing tourism boom are becoming increasingly apparent. Figuratively speaking, a seaside town in a working overalls looks into the mirror of the Caspian Sea and tries on resort outfits.</p>
	 <p class="info">Aktau was founded just over 50 years ago. The need for its construction in a desert and without fresh water corner of the Mangyshlak Peninsula was dictated by the development of the strategic deposits of uranium, oil and gas discovered here. Today, the wide avenues on the high limestone plateau are lined with beautiful modern buildings. The streets of the seaside quarters lead to a well-groomed embankment towering over the Caspian coast.</p>
	 <p class="info">Travelers who come to the city for the first time notice that the palette of green tones is clearly lacking in its spectacular urban landscape. Indeed, there is relatively little vegetation on the streets of Aktau, it is very difficult to grow trees and shrubs on a waterless stone plateau, plants require artificial irrigation, and fertile land for them is brought from afar. Urban designers replenish the color gamut of streets with bright, but not pretentious coloring of facades, attractive ornaments and drawings on the blank end walls of high-rise buildings. Recently, the walls of houses of one of the residential micro-districts of Aktau were decorated with huge portraits of the national heroes of Kazakh history and culture, beloved by the people. The lack of greenery is compensated by the proximity of the Caspian Sea, the fresh sea breeze blowing across the streets, the abundance of comfortable beaches a stone's throw from the city center.</P>

	 <h2>NUR-SULTAN</h2>
	 <p class="info">Nur-Sultan, formerly (until 1961) Akmolinsk, (1961–92) Tselinograd, (1992–98) Aqmola, and (1998–2019) Astana, city, capital of Kazakhstan. Nur-Sultan lies in the north-central part of the country, along the Ishim River, at the junction of the Trans-Kazakhstan and South Siberian railways.</p>
	 <p class="info">It was founded in 1824 as a Russian military outpost and became an administrative centre in 1868. Its population had reached 33,000 when it was made an oblast (province) centre in 1939. The city’s importance was greatly enhanced during the Soviet period by the government’s Virgin and Idle Lands Campaign of the mid-1950s—Tselinograd was Russian for “City of the Virgin Lands”—and by the city’s role as capital of a kray (region) that united the five northern provinces of the Kazakh Soviet Socialist Republic in 1960–65. There was much new construction and the establishment of various research and higher educational institutions (teacher training, agriculture, medicine, and engineering and construction).</p>
	 <p class="info">The city’s name was changed to Aqmola (“White Grave”) in 1992 following Kazakhstan’s independence. In 1994 the Kazakh government resolved to transfer the national capital from Almaty to Aqmola, a process completed in 1997, and the city’s name was again changed, to Astana (“Capital”), the following year. Kazakh Pres. Nursultan Nazarbayev spent vast sums of the country’s oil profits on a drastic expansion and reconstruction of Astana. The government hired Japanese architect Kurokawa Kishō to design the plan for Astana’s new broad avenues and blue-and-gold buildings, including the Presidential Palace. Nazarbayev also employed British architect Sir Norman Foster to design the new Palace of Peace and Reconciliation, a 203-foot- (62-metre-) high pyramid that includes, among other things, a library and an opera house. The city continued to develop rapidly throughout Nazarbayev’s presidency, and, on March 20, 2019, the day after he left office, the city was renamed Nur-Sultan in his honour.</P>

	 <h2>TURKESTAN</h2>
	 <p class="info">Turkestan (kaz. Turkistan) is a city in the south of Kazakhstan, not far from the Syrdarya river. Since June 19, 2018 it has been the administrative center of the Turkestan region (previously - South Kazakhstan region) [6]. One of the oldest cities in Kazakhstan. Located 160 km north-west of Shymkent on the Tashkent railway between Kyzylorda and Tashkent.</p>
	 <p class="info">The city of Turkestan, located in the middle of the arid steppes of the extreme south of Kazakhstan, is a real gift from the history of the tourism industry. While neighboring Uzbekistan has a whole bunch of cities on the Great Silk Road with sights of the corresponding scale and splendor, Kazakhstan has remained on the sidelines of trade routes and does not particularly boast of settlements with a long history. Turkestan is a happy exception. This city with 1500 years of history is today one of the most important centers of Muslim pilgrimage in Central Asia, and the mausoleum of the Sufi poet Khoja Ahmed Yasawi, built by Tamerlane, is also a major tourist attraction.</p>
	 <p class="info">In Turkestan (and in general in the South Kazakhstan region), a temperate desert climate prevails with strong temperature fluctuations throughout the year. In winter, it is mostly -5 .. -7 ° C, but sometimes the temperature drops to -15 ° C. In summer, the thermometer confidently keeps at around +30 ° C, often creeping up to +40 ° C. The best time to visit Turkestan is from March to June and from September to November.</P>

	 <h2>CHARYN CANYON</h2>
	 <p class="info">Charyn Canyon (also known as Sharyn Canyon, Kazakh: Шарын шатқалы, Sharyn shatqaly) is a canyon on the Sharyn River in Kazakhstan (200 kilometres (120 mi) east of Almaty, close to the Chinese border). The canyon is roughly 154 kilometres (96 mi) in length. It is part of the Charyn National Park (established on 23 February 2004), and is located within the territory of the Uygur District, Raiymbek District and Enbekshikazakh District (of the Almaty Province). Over time, the canyon has gained colorful formations of varying shapes and sizes. Though it is much smaller than the Grand Canyon, it has been described as being equally impressive</p>
	 <p class="info">The Charyn Canyon is the oldest natural landmark located on the territory of the Charyn National Park. The national park was created in 2004 to preserve and restore unique natural monuments. The natural complex is located 200 km from Almaty.
The formation of the canyon is associated with the drainage of Lake Ili. The canyon is composed of soft sedimentary rocks that are 12 million years old. Its length is 154 km along the Charyn River, and the height of sheer cliffs, which is 150-300 meters, is surprising. The unique natural landscape of the Charyn canyon attracts domestic and foreign tourists with its bizarre rocks and the unusual atmosphere of the place. Some travelers call this place the younger brother of the Grand Canyon, it is considered the younger only in area, but is not inferior in beauty and grandeur.</p>
	 <p class="info">The Charyn Canyon is the subject of folk tales and legends. Locals call this place "Stone Bag" or "Dragon's Gorge". The people who inhabited this place many centuries ago believed that spirits dwell here, which it is better not to disturb.
The wind in the gorge creates a unique atmosphere, its hum is strange and unusual, as if trying to convey something to the tourists passing along the narrow paths.
Until now, there is a popular belief that Charyn is guarded by good spirits.</P>
